## My process

### Built with

-   Semantic HTML5 markup
-   CSS custom properties
-   Flexbox
-   Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

Flexbox properties were something that I wasn't able to practically use them. This project helped me in getting one of these right, the `flex` property.

I used this property in aligning the button to the end without using grid.
The paragraph grows to eat the available space even when the content is short for the height, thereby preventing the undesired button placement otherwise.
